# Hello World!

## Assignment
For this first problem, all I want you to do is to write code that will do the following things:

1. Print the phrase `hello world!` to the console (using `console.log`)
2. Print the numbers 1 through 10 to the console

You can run the program by entering the following command in the terminal:
`> node problem1.js`

If you've completed the assignment correctly, you should see the following output in the terminal:
```hello world!
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
```

## Commit Your Changes With Git!
Once you're satisfied with your code, add it to the project using git. For now, we'll just do our work directly
in the `master` branch:

1. Stage your code with the following command:
   `> git add problem1.js`
2. Commit your code with the following command:
   `> git commit -m '<<Describe what you did>>'`
3. Push your changes to the main repository:
   `> git push origin`

At this point, your changes should be visible in GitHub, and I should be able to see the changes as well.
